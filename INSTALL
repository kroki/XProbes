Installation Instructions
*************************

You can find the standard GNU INSTALL file with general configure
instructions elsewhere.  Here's a short version.

If you checked out this project from git repository, then first run

  ./bootstrap.sh

to initialize autotools framework.

To build the project, run

  ./configure
  make
  make check

To install it, run

  make install


Additional options to configure:

  --enable-dlerror        assume dlerror() is thread-safe [default=if found]
  --enable-dladdr         assume dladdr() may be called from object
                          constructor (i.e. from dlopen()) [default=if found]
  --disable-control       do not build xprobes control utility [default=build]


If you are doing 64-bit build, and your system keeps 64-bit libraries
in /lib64, pass --libdir='${exec_prefix}/lib64' to ./configure above.
You can build both library types with

  ./configure --libdir='${exec_prefix}/lib64'
  make
  make check
  make install

  make clean
  ./configure --disable-control CC='gcc -m32' CXX='g++ -m32'
  make
  make check
  make install-exec
