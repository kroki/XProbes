Explicit probes
===============


0.3  2010-02-15

       Give -Wmissing-prototypes what it wants.


0.2  2010-02-15

       Listing commands (objects/sites/modules/probes) now take
       optional filter pattern.  For instance

         xprobes> sites *lib*:*func*

       will list sites matching '*func*' from objects matching
       '*lib*'.  Backslash escapes wildcard meaning, so

         xprobes> probes :*\**

       lists all probes that use '*' wildcard in their pattern.


0.1  2010-02-13

       First release.  I will use consecutive version numbers starting
       from 0.1, so it being less that one doesn't imply alpha state
       or something.
